### Brief Description of the Web Application:
IntelliCart is a web application designed to simplify your shopping experience. Users can input their shopping list or specify a project they wish to undertake, such as baking a cake or building a shed. IntelliCart then intelligently maps out the nearest stores that have the required materials, highlighting the ones with the best prices. This ensures users can efficiently gather everything they need while saving money.

### Required Elements:
- **User Authentication**: Implement secure login and registration for users.
- **Prompt Input**: Allow users to input a list of shopping material they want.
- **AI Integration**: Use AI to generate what elements are needed in a User's build (what ingredients will be needed to make a cake).
- **Mapping**: Displaying the locations of the stores on a map.
- **Price Comparison**: Identifying the cheapest options for the required materials..
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application is accessible on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

### Additional Requirements:
- **User Dashboard**: Develop a dashboard for users to view their shopping carts.
- **Previous Purchases**: Implement a system that tracks the User's previous purchases and/or which shops they have gone too.
- **Recommender**: Based on previous user inputs, recommend possibly other items they may also want to purchase.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Allow users to provide feedback on generated content for continuous improvement.
